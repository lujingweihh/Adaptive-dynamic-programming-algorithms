# Adaptive dynamic programming
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of fundamental ADP algorithms, including iterative and online ADP, are provided. 
 
 Currently added ADP algorithms include:
 - Value iteraion for discrete-time systems
 - Policy iteration for discrete-time systems
 - Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) for continuous-time systems
